# Frontend Mentor - Base Apparel Coming Soon Page

This is my solution to the [Base Apparel coming soon page challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/base-apparel-coming-soon-page-5d46b47f8db8a7063f9331a0). The goal was to build a responsive, accessible, and visually accurate landing page based on a provided design.

## üîç Overview

### The Challenge

## üõ† My Process

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5
- CSS Flexbox and responsive media queries
- `object-fit: cover` + image fallback for better responsiveness
- JavaScript email validation
- Mobile-first approach

### What I Learned

This challenge reinforced the importance of precise layout alignment and responsive behavior. I also learned how even simple email validation can affect form usability and perceived quality. Switching from `background-image` to `<img>` + `object-fit` solved an issue with scaling images responsively across viewports.

### Continued Development

I'd like to explore:

- More advanced accessibility features (like ARIA attributes)
- Better cross-browser testing setup
- Componentization of forms using frameworks like React
